	<h1>The Sea Turtle</h1>

	<p>The Sea Turtle is my favorite animal.  From birth through it's whole life, it's an amazing example of nature's resiliancy and beauty.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Sea Turtles live their lives in and around the ocean (duh).  They dive to the sea floor to eat vegetation.  Sea Turtles live long, full lives.  They lay clutches of eggs in the sand, and then the babies hatch and crawl their way across the beach into the ocean</p>
